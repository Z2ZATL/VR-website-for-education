This project aims to develop a website on the Virtual Reality (VR) platform to be used as an effective learning media. It focuses on addressing the lack of engaging and interactive learning resources, as well as the limitations in accessing certain types of learning resources. This project will utilize VR technology to create a simulated environment that allows learners to learn and interact with content more effectively and engagingly.
The developed VR website will cover a variety of content suitable for the target audience, focusing on creating learning experiences that promote engagement and hands-on interactive learning. Additionally, the website will enable learners to safely and conveniently access learning resources that are difficult to access in the real world.
This project is expected to significantly enhance the efficiency and learning experience of learners by creating an engaging and interactive simulated environment, helping learners understand the content well, and promoting learning through hands-on practice and experimentation in a virtual environment.
